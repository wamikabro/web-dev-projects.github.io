# Carousel for Testimonials

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-Welcome-brightgreen.svg)]()

This project is a testimonial carousel built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to navigate through different client testimonials using navigation arrows or indicators.

## Features

- **Manual Navigation:** Users can manually scroll through testimonials using the left and right arrows.
- **Indicators:** The carousel includes clickable indicators for each testimonial, allowing easy access to specific slides.
- **No Infinite Looping:** The carousel does not loop back to the first testimonial when reaching the end, and vice versa.

## Live Demo
